Started the day by reviewing the team's project deadlines. I have a few action items for the upcoming client presentation. My task is to finalize the slide deck and prepare key points for the demo. I set aside the afternoon for working on it.

Had a 3 PM meeting with the marketing team to discuss the new campaign. We decided to move forward with the digital ads targeting the younger demographic, especially on Instagram and TikTok. I was tasked with preparing an analysis report for the campaign's expected ROI.

In the evening, I reviewed the budget for the upcoming quarter. We are slightly over budget for the last month, so I need to have a discussion with the finance team tomorrow to see where we can cut down on expenses.

Today, I finalized the client presentation slides and made sure everything was aligned with their requirements. The meeting with the client went well. They were pleased with the overall progress, but they requested some additional features for the product. I noted down their feedback and will meet with the development team on Friday to discuss these changes.

Received an email from the legal department regarding the contract with the new vendor. They suggested some revisions, so I need to review the contract and set up a call with them next week.

In the evening, I made a to-do list for the following day. I need to prepare for the budget meeting with finance and send out an email with the meeting agenda.

In the evening, I checked the email from the legal team regarding the vendor contract. I’ll make sure to set up a call with them next week. I also started preparing for the upcoming team meeting, where I need to present a progress update on the client project.
